				<span class="byline">
					Our core goal is to teach anyone skills valuable to a startup. Whether you have little programming experience or if you have attended multiple hackathons -- everyone can learn something new.

          Stay on campus for intersession and build a prototype that could form the basis of a startup in just a week. You'll get hands-on experience about both the technical and business aspects of doing a startup, and you'll add an awesome project to your portfolio.

          Jason House is currently a Director of Business Development at Appinions, a young company based in NYC providing influence measurement services to the marketing departments of Fortune 500 companies. Although he has had an amazing two year experience working at a growth stage startup, he is most excited for an upcoming career shift, as in April he will be moving to Bishanpur, Bihar a village in Northwest India to join SEEKHO. SEEKHO is an educational NGO working to develop a scalable and sustainable model for implementing Positive Education and well-being into existing education systems. This approach of Positive Education is a burgeoning movement out of UPENN's Positive Psychology Center based on two decades of research and findings that have not only demonstrated that character and social-emotional intelligence can be taught, but also have also indicated that these positive character traits increase well-being in a way that facilitates learning, better health, less prejudiced attitudes, and higher future earnings. Jason is extremely passionate about applying lean business development practices and design thinking methodologies to the world of positive social impact, and encourages anyone at all curious or interested in this intersection to take the next step. (Or ask me about SEEKHO's summer fellowship program)

          Firebase is a realtime backend as a service for building collaborative, modern applications. By replacing the traditional request / response model with a data synchronization approach, developers can get apps up and running in minutes. Apps built with Firebase can be written entirely with client-side code, scale automatically, and update across clients in realtime.
